TODOLIST
--------
1. [X] Add - Exception Classes to handle errors and what not.
2. [X] Develop a View core lib class that loads views as objects and handle __set calls 
so when adding variables to the view it'll work inside the view file.  Include an auto_render = TRUE setting
so we can disable the rendering for ajax calls and what not etc.. Like KohanaPHP
3. [X] Incorperate the view class into the template_controller and render the output.
4. [X] Update __autoload to work with web controller libs
5. [X] Clean up code and add comments etc..

6. [X] default controller - ADDED
7. Add in 404 pages when error messages are turned off

GOAL: Everything run off libraries: DB, RSS, etc.. Ultra Light. Minimum Work for this Mini Framework.  Be able
to create any library, plug it in and work out the box with ease

Future Ideas

1. htaccess with seo clean urls
2. default controller - ADDED
