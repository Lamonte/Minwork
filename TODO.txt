TODOLIST
--------
1. Add - Exception Classes to handle errors and what not.
2. Develop a View core lib class that loads views as objects and handle __set calls 
so when adding variables to the view it'll work inside the view file.  Include an auto_render = TRUE setting
so we can disable the rendering for ajax calls and what not etc.. Like KohanaPHP
3. Incorperate the view class into the template_controller and render the output.
4. Update __autoload to work with web controller libs
5. Clean up code and add comments etc..

GOAL: Everything run off libraries: DB, RSS, etc.. Ultra Light. Minimum Work for this Mini Framework.  Be able
to create any library, plug it in and work out the box with ease
