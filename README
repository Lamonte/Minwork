Minwork is a light framework using PHP5, it has the basics of a MVC minus a lot.

It focuses mostly on Controllers and Templates while libraries will be plug and play and control your whole script.
There will be a database library packed with the final release, but there is no models like most traditional frameworks.

My goal for this project is to: Have something light, VERY VERY VERY light weight and extendable.  I wanted something where controllers and views were the base and custom libraries finished the job.  That way if I wanted to make a simple application or a complete cms this base would be easy to work from.
